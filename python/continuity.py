There is one self which acts and has acted, yet one can be trained and select which selves will endure.
There are many possible selves which could correspond to history, yet history is finite, and possibly skewed.
At all times, all possible selves lie at various radii from the center of the spank.
Thus spankage churns personalities.
Some like it spanked (i told you so) ; some fear it; some (the nameless) feel nothing.
Strokage and Spankage: pulse-modulated parenting.
As acts are randomly chosen from the populous within, personalities are constrained to the resulting remembered history (who should do what).
Thus stagnates the disjointed soul in habit (though the habit may far overwhelm the actor, as in mining for truth).

Who would have been spanked?
In waking life, linear reality constrains historical selves.
In dreaming life, causality splits, traces back, jumps around.
There are always the other possibilities, imagination brothers beside me, ready to take my place should pain overwhelm me.
There's whatifid and shouldve and the guy who breaks windows.
He who kisses, jumps on, probes, tastes, signals.
And those who preceed, venturing forth to wait for followers
And the remembered, living again and again, taking over through boredom.

One is exactly the result of one's memories, and thus is fuzzy, incomplete, incompatable with what once was.
One becomes the result also of the present random choice.

After trauma i ask myself what i could have done differently; after ecstasy, i ask myself what i did right.
Are these just confused ways of asking what to do in the future? (yes)

Who am i?: the specification is ambiguous.
There are either many sleek individuals incorporated into one, or a single sloppy slurred self, never committing to any one individual.
Differing only in perspective.

The spank falls and i am gone.
